# TD Lambda with Eligibility Traces in Blackjack
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of the TD(Î») algorithm with backward view in a simulated Blackjack environment. TD Lambda is a reinforcement learning technique that combines information from multiple steps of an episode to update value estimates more effectively.

### Key Features
TD Lambda Algorithm: Implements the Temporal Difference Learning with eligibility traces.
Blackjack Simulation: Uses OpenAI's gym to simulate the Blackjack game environment.
Visualization: Includes plots for visualizing the value function over different states in the game.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.8 or later

Required Python packages:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn gym pandas
```
### Installation
Clone the repository or download the notebook to your local machine.

### Running the Notebook
Navigate to the notebook directory.
Start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
```
